used mapper to partion to child segment(s) strategy, 

Extendable mapper counts and partion and child segment(s) Unlimited expansion.

override this internal function can be MR operation.

Very efficient ARC cached strategy in memory,

Two independent KEY And VALUE class. Different from traditional map,

At the same time, we refer to the cache obvious idea,

But not limited to B-tree or B plus tree, it can be expanded horizontally or in columns,

I think streaming and partitioning are good choices,

I like to think about problems and solve them, not copy them :)
